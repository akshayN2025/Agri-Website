            <h3>Soil Preparation : </h3>
            <p class="gf">Rice is a resilient plant and can grow in almost all types of soil. As long as it is irrigated sufficiently
                (either by irrigation or by rainfall), it can grow in both wet or dry fields. However, since we expect a good
                yield from our field, we have to prepare the soil, so that it can welcome either the young rice plants
                (transplant method) or the pre-germinated and incubated seeds (direct seeding method).There are two major types
                of land preparation, wet preparation, and dry preparation.
        
                Wet Preparation
        
                Wet preparation is an option for upland and lowland fields. This method requires a large amount of water to
                prepare the field for the near future cultivation. With this method, the soil is adequately tilled in
                waterlogged conditions. We can take into consideration the following steps to prepare the rice paddy.
        
                Dry Preparation
        
                Dry preparation is an option for both lowland and upland fields. This kind of preparation needs less water. We
                can take into account the following steps to prepare the rice paddy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="def" id="2">
              <h3>Sowing : </h3>
              <p class="gf">1. Broadcasting method:
                Seeds are sown broadcast by hand. This method is practised in those areas which are comparatively dry and less fertile and do not have much labour to work in the fields. It is the easiest method requiring minimum input but its yields are also minimum.
                
                2. Drilling method:
                Ploughing of land and sowing of seeds is done by two persons. This method is mostly confined to peninsular India.
                
                3. Transplantation method:
                This method is practised in areas of fertile soil, abundant rainfall and plentiful supply of labour. To begin with, seeds are sown in nursery and seedlings are prepared. After 4-5 weeks the seedlings are uprooted and planted in the field which has already been prepared for the purpose. The entire process is done by hand. It is, therefore, a very difficult method and requires heavy inputs. But at the same time it gives some of the highest yields.
        
                4. Japanese method:
                This method includes the use of high yielding varieties of seeds, sowing the seeds in a raised nursery-bed and transplanting the seedlings in rows so as to make weeding and fertilizing easy. It also involves the use of a heavy dose of fertilizers so that very high yields are obtained. The Japanese method of rice cultivation has been successfully adopted in the main rice producing regions of India.

              <h3>Harvesting : </h3>
              <p class="gf">It is very important to harvest rice crops on time in order to maximize grain quality and yields. If we harvest
                too early, collected grains will be immature and as a result they will have poor milling recovery and they will
                break easily. On the other hand, when crops are harvested late, grain may fall from the panicle and lead to
                heavy losses. As a general rule, the harvest may begin only when grains are ripened in a percentage of 80-85% or
                have a golden yellow color.
        
                Harvesting can take place manually or mechanically. In manual harvesting, workers collect rice plants from the
                rice paddies using sharp knives. Then, they carefully clean them and separate the damaged ones. Mechanical
                harvesting can be done by using machines that combine all the operations, such as cutting, threshing and
                cleaning.
        
                Post-Harvest Handling
        
                After harvesting, rice seeds normally need to be stored in silos and dry artificially, so that the seed moisture
                content can be reduced to 13-14%.
        
                Rice Drying Process
        
                Drying is an important procedure to reduce grain moisture. After the harvest, grains normally contain about 25%
                moisture. If we let them without doing anything, this may lead to grain discoloration and potential attacks from
                pests. So, before storing grains, in most cases, farmers dry the grains out. There are two ways of drying. The
                traditional and mechanical methods. In most cases, it is essential to dry the grains within 24 hours after
                harvesting.
        
                Traditional Drying
        
                Because of its low and almost zero cost, traditional drying is preferred and practiced in plenty of countries.
                We can dry rice grain by exposing it to sunlight. Workers can spread the grains to rugs or sidewalks until they
                dry.
        
                Mechanical Drying
        
                This method is based on removing water from the grains with heated air. This can be done with different types of
                dryers.
        
                The average yield of rice (seeds) per hectare is 3 – 6 tons. In some countries like Australia and in Egypt, the
                yield can increase to an amazing 10 – 12 tons or more per hectare. (1 ton = 1000 kg = 2200 lbs. and 1 hectare =
                2,47 acres = 10.000 square meters). Of course, such high yields can be accomplished by experienced farmers after
                several years of practice</p>

        <div class="def" id="4">
              <h3>Irrigation : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Irrigation is an important stage in paddy crop. Sufficient availability of irrigation is very important for paddy
                crop. In food grain crops, it requires more water rather than other crops. In paddy crop, 1500-2500 mm water is
                required.
        
                Direct sowing varieties require less water than transplanting varieties. For direct sowing varieties, irrigation
                should be done at the interval of 7-8 days.
        
                It is necessary to fill the water in paddy field up to 4-5 cm after 2-3 week of transplanting because it
                increases nutrient availability and weed outbreak also reduces in the land. Along with that there should be a
                proper arrangement of drainage in the field because more water causes insect and disease, by which crop
                production decreases</p>
        </div>

        <div class="def" id="5">
              <h3>Storage : </h3>
              <p class="gf">The purpose of any grain storage facility is to provide safe storage conditions for the grain in order to prevent grain loss caused by adverse weather, moisture, rodents, birds, insects and micro-organisms like fungi.

                In general, it is recommended that rice for food purposes be stored in paddy form rather than milled rice as the husk provides some protection against insects and helps prevent quality deterioration.
                
                However, when rice can be stored as brown rice, 20% less storage capacity will be needed. Brown rice is rice grain with its hulls removed but not polished. Under tropical conditions brown rice has a very short shelf life, approximately two weeks.
                Rice storage facilities take many forms depending on the quantity of grain to be stored, the purpose of storage, and the location of the store.
        
                Storage systems can be through bag, bulk, or hermetic containers.</p>
