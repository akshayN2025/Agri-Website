            <h3>Soil Preparation : </h3>
            <p class="gf">Generally, wheat can be cultivated easily in each type of land but loamy soil is best for its growth.

                Along with this, proper arrangement of drainage is also necessary in the land. Special care should be taken that the land is not acidic and alkaline.
                
                It can also be grown easily in black soil. The soil having pH 5-7 is considered good for its cultivation.
                
                During land preparation, one ploughing should be done with MB plow and 2-3 ploughing with harrow or cultivator.
                
                After this, the land should be leveled after every ploughing. When preparing the field, apply enough cow dung in the soil.</p>

              <h3>Sowing : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Methods of sowing

                Wheat is sown by the following methods-
                
                1) Broadcasting:  
                
                This method is as old as agriculture itself but it has several draw backs viz. all seeds do not get better soil moisture contact and do not germinate, a part of the seed is eaten up by birds and ants etc., which results in uneven and poor germination. Thus, If needs abut 25 per cent higher seed over the recommended one.
                
                2) Sowing in furrows:
                
                After proper seed bed preparation the seed is dropped in furrows behind the country plough by hand (Kerri method). Some times a funnel attached with an iron pipe in the hand of plough (pora/nai method) and the seed is dropped at desired depth and spacing for obtaining satisfactory germination
                
                3) Dibbling:
                
                The method was popularized during early sixties and proved under limited seed availability however, being time taking cumbersive and labour intensive it could not be commercialized.
                
                4) Drilling:
                
                The sowing is done through seed drills/seed cum fertilizer drill and it has gained popularity.  In this way the seeds droped at uniform depth and results in uniform germination and regular stand.
                
                5) Zero-Till Seed Drill (ZTSD):
                
                 The ZTSD was developed by G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology for rice-wheat cropping system zones, which is used for sowing of wheat seed and in rice stubbles immediately after harvest of rice, to utilized the residual soil moisture and reduce the period, otherwise required for seed bed preparation. It is now gaining popularity as it results in nearly equal productivity as obtained by conventional method of sowing done about a fortnight earlier. For grater advantage the established weeds must be removed and bunds prepared in the field should be broken.
                
                6) Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed (FIRB):
                
                 This method has been evolved to economize irrigation water in which raised beds of prepared to accommodate 2 or 3 rows of wheat between two furrows. The irrigation is done only in furrows. Thus about half of the irrigation required may be saved by this method without any loss to the productivity of wheat grain. The wheat yield has been found to be higher then conventional method at Directorate of Wheat Research (DWR), Karnal. A machine has been developed to make raised bed and sowing of wheat simultaneously has been developed for this purpose. This method helps in economizing water required by the crop besides giving better germination.

        <div class="def" id="3">
              <h3>Harvesting : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Harvesting stage comes when normally the plant turns golden yellow and becomes brittle.The grains become hard and the straw turns dry.
                The crop should be harvested at physiological maturity when the grain moisture is around 19-20%.The harvesting time varies from zone to zone and state to state.
                Harvest and thresh high yielding wheat varieties as soon as fully ripe, to avoid grain shattering.
                The harvesting of wheat can be started five days earlier than dead ripe stage without adverse effect on the yield or quality of the grains.
                The harvesting can be done with the help of serrated sickle manually or with the help of bullock drawn reapers.
                Harvesting can also be done with the help combine harvesters they can also be hired as they are easily available on hire basis.
                The advantage of using the combine harvetser is that it does the job of harvesting, winnowing and thresing at the same time.
                Tractor-operated vertical conveyer reaper windrowers can also be used for harvesting.</p>

        <div class="def" id="4">
              <h3>Irrigation : </h3>
              <p class="gf">In wheat crops, farmers often apply irrigation through sprinklers (artificial rain) since the very close plant
                distances do not allow the application of furrow irrigation. According to University of California Davis, drip
                and sprinkler irrigation systems can apply smaller amounts of water than surface flood systems, and therefore,
                less applied water moves past the root zone of wheat. Frequent irrigation with sprinkler systems can result in
                rapid disease development in wheat crop. Surface flood systems are more efficient at leaching salts, which is
                important if salts are a problem for the wheat crop. Flood irrigation in wheat farming is most common in the
                Central Valley and Low Desert regions of California, whereas, sprinklers are more common in the Intermountain
                Region. Research has proven that with the optimum irrigation amount, increasing drip irrigation frequency can
                increase wheat root length and root weight and aboveground biomass accumulation, thereby improving yield and
                water use efficiency.</p>

              <h3>Storage : </h3>
              <p class="gf">i) For Home Consumption

                Improved storage structures of various capacities of 1.5, 3.5, 10 and 15 quintals capacity are available.
                For outdoor use, drawings of PAU metal bins of 15-tonnes capacity with perforated floor-bottom, rooms storage structure of 8-tonnes capacity and flat storage structures of 100 tonnes capacity is available.
                The airtight bin is so constructed that it does not allow entry of any outside insect and rodent and the insects present in the grains do not get favorable atmosphere to develop.
                It is also economical portable and simple to fabricate.
                
                For lifting and using the PAU metal bins, the following storage practices are recommended.
                
                Clean the bin thoroughly and do not allow the left-over of the previously stored grains to remain in the bin. Inspect the covers to ensure that the gaskets are intact.
                Clean and sort the grains of all impurities. Broken kernels and other impurities lead to insect attraction and hence should be separated
                ii) For commercial purposes
        
                For storing wheat for commercial purposes, the farmers should make use of the facilities, provided by the following agencies.
        
                i. State Warehousing Corporation in the state and its regional office.
                ii. Central warehousing Corporation and its regional offices.
                iii. Food Corporation of India and its branches</p>
