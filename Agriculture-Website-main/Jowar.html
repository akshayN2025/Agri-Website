            <h3>Soil Preparation : </h3>
            <p class="gf">Generally, wheat can be cultivated easily in each type of land but loamy soil is best for its growth.

                Along with this, proper arrangement of drainage is also necessary in the land. Special care should be taken that the land is not acidic and alkaline.
                
                It can also be grown easily in black soil. The soil having pH 5-7 is considered good for its cultivation.
                
                During land preparation, one ploughing should be done with MB plow and 2-3 ploughing with harrow or cultivator.
                
                After this, the land should be leveled after every ploughing. When preparing the field, apply enough cow dung in the soil.</p>

              <h3>Sowing : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Jowar, also known as sorghum, is an important cereal crop in many parts of the world. If you are interested in sowing jowar, here are some things you should keep in mind:

                Climate: Jowar can be grown in a variety of climatic conditions, but it prefers warm and humid weather. The ideal temperature for jowar growth is between 25°C to 32°C.
                
                Soil: Jowar grows well in sandy loam or clay loam soils with good drainage. The soil pH should be between 6.5 to 7.5.
                
                Land preparation: Prepare the land by ploughing or digging it well. Remove any weeds or debris from the field. Level the field and create furrows for sowing.
                
                Seed rate: The recommended seed rate for jowar is 12 to 15 kg per hectare.
                
                Sowing time: Jowar can be sown in different seasons depending on the climate. In India, it is usually sown between May and July, and again between September and October.
                
                Sowing method: Jowar can be sown using either broadcast or line sowing method. In broadcast sowing, the seeds are scattered randomly over the field. In line sowing, the seeds are sown in rows.
                
                Fertilizer application: Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. Generally, a basal dose of 50 kg of nitrogen, 25 kg of phosphorus, and 25 kg of potassium per hectare is recommended.
                
                Irrigation: Jowar requires moderate irrigation. The first irrigation should be given immediately after sowing, and subsequent irrigations should be given at an interval of 10 to 15 days.
                
                Weed control: Keep the field weed-free by manual or chemical means. Pre-emergence application of herbicides is recommended.
                
                Harvesting: Jowar is harvested when the grains have matured and turned hard. The crop is usually ready for harvesting after 90 to 120 days of sowing.

              <h3>Harvesting : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Jowar is usually ready for harvesting after 90 to 120 days of sowing. Here are the steps involved in the harvesting of jowar:

                Checking the maturity of the crop: The first step in harvesting jowar is to check the maturity of the crop. The grains should have matured and turned hard.
                
                Cutting the crop: Once the crop is mature, it is cut using a sickle or a mechanized harvester. The cut crop is then tied into bundles.
                
                Stacking the bundles: The bundles are then stacked in the field for a few days to allow the grains to dry completely.
                
                Threshing: After the bundles have dried, the grains are separated from the stalks through a process called threshing. This can be done using a thresher or by beating the bundles with sticks to separate the grains.
                
                Winnowing: The grains are then winnowed to remove any remaining chaff or debris. This is done by tossing the grains in the air and letting the wind blow away the chaff.
                
                Cleaning and storage: The grains are then cleaned and stored in a dry and cool place to prevent any spoilage.
                
                It is important to note that the timing of harvesting jowar is crucial. If the crop is harvested too early, the grains may not have fully developed, and if it is harvested too late, the grains may have already fallen off the stalks. Therefore, it is important to harvest jowar at the right time to ensure a good yield.</p>

              <h3>Irrigation : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Jowar requires moderate irrigation for proper growth and development. The frequency and amount of irrigation depend on various factors such as soil moisture, climate, and stage of growth.

                Here are some guidelines for jowar irrigation:
                
                Pre-sowing irrigation: The field should be irrigated before sowing to ensure that there is enough moisture in the soil to support germination.
                
                Initial irrigation: The first irrigation should be given immediately after sowing to help the seeds germinate and establish well.
                
                Subsequent irrigations: Subsequent irrigations should be given at an interval of 10 to 15 days depending on the soil moisture level. The frequency of irrigation should be increased during the flowering and grain-filling stages.
                
                Water requirement: Jowar requires about 500-600 mm of water per season. This can be met through rainfall and irrigation.
                
                Irrigation methods: Jowar can be irrigated using different methods such as surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and drip irrigation. Surface irrigation is the most common method used for jowar cultivation.
                
                Avoid waterlogging: Jowar should not be grown in areas with poor drainage or where there is a risk of waterlogging as it can lead to root rot and reduce yields.
                
                Soil moisture monitoring: Regular monitoring of soil moisture is essential for effective irrigation management. This can be done using a soil moisture meter or by observing the soil moisture level at different depths.
                
                By following these guidelines, farmers can ensure that their jowar crop receives adequate moisture throughout its growth cycle, resulting in healthy plant growth and high yields.

        <div class="def" id="5">
              <h3>Storage : </h3>
              <p class="gf">Proper storage is essential to maintain the quality of jowar and prevent any spoilage or infestation. Here are some guidelines for storing jowar:

                Drying: Before storing jowar, it should be dried to a moisture content of 12% to 14%. Proper drying helps to prevent mold growth and insect infestation.
                
                Cleaning: Jowar should be cleaned thoroughly to remove any foreign material, such as chaff or dirt, before storing. This helps to prevent any contamination and ensures good quality grain.
                
                Storage location: Jowar should be stored in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated location. The storage area should be protected from direct sunlight, moisture, and pests.
                
                Containers: Jowar can be stored in sacks or containers made of materials such as jute, polypropylene, or plastic. The containers should be clean and free from any odor.
                
                Pesticides: Pesticides can be used to prevent insect infestation during storage. However, it is important to use pesticides that are safe for human consumption and follow the recommended dosage.
                
                Monitoring: Regular monitoring of the stored jowar is essential to ensure that it is free from pests or any spoilage. The grain should be checked for any signs of mold, discoloration, or insect damage.
                
                By following these guidelines, farmers and grain handlers can ensure that the jowar is stored properly, maintaining its quality and preventing any losses due to spoilage or contamination.</p>
